        <p>
          At <strong>Rewear</strong>, we believe fashion shouldn't cost the planet. Our platform empowers people to exchange gently-used clothing through direct swaps or a point-based system, helping extend the lifecycle of garments while reducing textile waste.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whether you're cleaning out your closet or looking for unique pieces, Rewear makes it easy to refresh your wardrobe sustainably. Every item you list earns you points, which you can use to redeem items shared by others. You can also swap directly with other users for mutual benefit.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our mission is to promote circular fashion, reduce fast fashion‚Äôs impact, and build a conscious community of fashion lovers who care about people and the planet.
